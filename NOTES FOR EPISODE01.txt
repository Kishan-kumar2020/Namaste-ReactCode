PART 01

PART 02
    # After including CDN links, building basic hellow world program using react

# index.html
creating a element is the core thing of react that comes from react.development.js
creating a root is comes from the react-dom.development.js

PART 03
    # Creating a new js file to put all the js code inside that named as App.js

%% React was build with a philosophy that we have to manipulate our DOM using JavaScript
--> The most costly operation in the webpage is when the DOM nodes needs to be manipulated

What are the powers of head Tag
What is the tailwind css

React.createElement() is an object
heading react element // react h1 element

props are children + attributes

PART 04
    # Creating nested Elements using React.createElement

[] are used to create the element at the same level,  we have to convert children as array
We directly pass React.createElement to children to create the nested elements

Code structure becomes messy if we create in this way
So, there is JSX

What is this root.render() is doing
--> putting the heading tag inside the root tag
--> This will totally replace the root with only content that heading element (whatever we are passing in the root.render method) is bringing
    that are replaced not appended

As, it can work in the small portion of the app as well
while
A framework is that which comes with all things while react is the library
