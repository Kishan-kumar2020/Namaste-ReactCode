FOR EPISODE 2

PART 01
--> CODE THAT IS PRODUCTION READY
--> HOW YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN PRODUCTION READY CREATE REACT APP

What is NPM
NODE PACKAGE MANAGER (NOT CORRECT)
npm manages the packages but not stands for node package manager

npn init

// npm is the standard repository for all the packages
// package.json is the configuration for npm

What is a bundler?
example: webpack, wheat, bable, parcel

create-react-app  uses webpack bundler behind the scenes

npm install -D parcel

what is -D?
There are two dependencies
--> Dev dependency
--> Normal dependency --> used in production also

"parel": "^2.8.3"
^ carot --> upgrade minor versions generally
~ tilde --> upgrade major versions generally
What are that why are there?

What is package-lock.json?
As installed, why this file is created
This keeps the record of every version that is being installed
"parcel": "2.8.3."

What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
approx version and exact version

!! IT IS WORKING IN MY LOCAL NOT WORKING IN PRODUCTION !!
"integrity": "                                                 "

package-lock.json keeps the track of exact version that is in my local and also for production
